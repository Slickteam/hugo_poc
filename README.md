# Migration of Slickteam's website to Hugo

The purpose of this project was to migrate the content management of the website from WordPress to Hugo.

I did not spend time on the refactorisation of the frontend code. I just kept it like it was with the WordPress theme.

If you want to see some Hugo mechanisms and play with, you can grab this project as it is just a POC serving as base for his concepts.
